# PaintingPlace
This was a test program I made in Java when I was learning about GUIs.
It started out as a basic window witha few buttons and I went on to create something similar in style of a MS Paint. Added a drwaing area, added multiple buttons for different shapes, added buttons for multiple colors, as well as a save and load button.

This is a gif showcasing the program itself, its pretty basic and nothing fancy but was a great learning experience. Had I gone further with this project I would've added more icons, made the GUI look better, as well as make it more responsive.
