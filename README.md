# PaintingPlace
This was a test program I made in Java when I was learning about GUIs.
It started out as a basic window witha few buttons and I went on to create something similar in style of a MS Paint. Added a drwaing area, added multiple buttons for different shapes, added buttons for multiple colors, as well as a save and load button.
